# MechaNerd - A Guide To Mechanical Keyboards
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/mUyBGF9R_W8>
#### Description:

    MechaNerd is a website designed by me, with the goal of serving as a one-stop guide for those who are interested in learning more about mechanical keyboards.
    This was heavily inspired after my interest in learning mechanical keyboards, which was a steep learning slope due to its complexity of components and information avaliable.
    With reference to the MechanicalKeyboards Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/, while it was greatly informative with a wide variety of information, it
    was somewhat difficult to navigate for a total noobie like me.

    Thus, this website serves to simplify information for beginners to learn more about the hobby, in hopes of being able to spread greater love and joy of this community 
    to others. The theme of the website's design is minimalistic and user-friendly. Its features include:

    - a custom search engine to the subreddit for users
    - a top pinned post of the subreddit
    - showcase of different popular mechanical keyboards that may appeal to users
    - easy navigation around keyboards' main components - keyboards and switches

#### Execution:

    To execute the website, kindly download the code and use 'flask run'.
