#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/mUyBGF9R_W8>
#### Description:

    MechaNerd is a website designed by me, with the goal of serving as a one-stop guide for those who are interested in learning more about mechanical keyboards.
    This was heavily inspired after my interest in learning mechanical keyboards, which was a steep learning slope due to its complexity of components and information avaliable.
    With reference to the MechanicalKeyboards Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/, while it was greatly informative with a wide variety of information, it
    was somewhat difficult to navigate for a total noobie like me.

    Thus, this website serves to simplify information for beginners to learn more about the hobby, in hopes of being able to spread greater love and joy of this community to others.

    The theme of the website's design is minimalistic and user-friendly.
    While deciding on a layout for the website, I heavily referenced upon Bootstrap, as it was a great resources that provided asthetically pleasing but simple designs for HTML.
    In order to better understand how to navigate a typical keyboard website, I went through many different keyboard suppliers such as KpRepublic, Keychorn, GMMK to see how their website
    worked and try to weave some of the asthetics which I felt strongly with into my own website.

    The main features of this website include:

    - a custom search engine to the subreddit for users
    This was a feature that was inspired after navigating the subreddit online. It was more tedious to search through the subreddit directly as the default option for searching on Reddit desktop
    always led to a default 'all' search before giving an option to specialise to the particular subreddit you were browsing. As such, I decided to directly embed a direct search engine to the
    subreddit for easier accesss to resources.

    A post request is even used for the search engine with autocomplete set to off to provide greater security for users browsing the site. This was implemented after heavy consideration throughout
    the CS50 course about security and privacy of users online.

    - a top pinned post of the subreddit
    As users browsing on the websites, that are sure to be a multitude of questions that users might have. This embed posts directly stands out to them and allows them to easily access a platform to
    ask any further queries that they might have.

    - showcase of different popular mechanical keyboards that may appeal to users
    As a beginner to mechanical keyboards, my own primary concern was with understanding the different keyboard layouts and switches that I could choose from. Thus, I found this a priority to establish
    to first-timers of the webpage who would most likely wish to learn more about these basic components first before diving deeper into the other customizations avaliable.

    - easy navigation around keyboards' main components - keyboards and switches
    This is a section that is able to be easily expandable to provide a wide variety of options and opinons for users beyond just keyboards and switches, such as stabilisers or even keyboard rests.
